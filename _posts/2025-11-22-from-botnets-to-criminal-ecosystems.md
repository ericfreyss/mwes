When I defended my doctoral thesis in November 2015, I was trying to define a model for all malware at the time that was in some way connected to its owner, and I particularly advocated the following concept: to consider botnets not as mere networks of compromised machines, but as socio-technical assemblages composed of actors, infrastructure, economic flows, and organizational constraints.

This reading, which associates technical analysis with an understanding of human dynamics, led to speaking of systems rather than isolated tools, and of criminal ecosystems rather than discrete threats. I also emphasized the need for a proactive posture aimed at disrupting the criminal organization as a whole — not just its visible manifestations.

Ten years later, this perspective has lost none of its relevance. What has changed, however, is the scale of the phenomenon. The ecosystem logics observed in botnets have spread throughout cybercrime and have even taken root in certain segments of so-called “traditional” crime. To go further, one can notably read the book by Benoît Dupont (*Cybercrime, an Ecosystemic Approach to Cyberspace*, 2024), which develops the notion of project-based delinquency.

## From cyber threats to criminal ecosystems

Beginning in the 2010s, cybercrime underwent profound reconfiguration. Operations fragmented into a multitude of specialized roles: malware developers, initial access operators, infrastructure managers, data resellers, money launderers, technical service providers — and, as Benoît Dupont describes, it is organized around a service marketplace that allows each skill to be recruited, rented, or replaced according to current needs.

This segmentation, combined with extensive outsourcing, enabled the emergence of genuine criminal value chains, where each function can be rented, replaced, or automated.

This logic of modularity has become the norm. Groups no longer execute the entire chain themselves: they select, purchase, or combine services — “bulletproof” hosting, encryptors, ready-to-use kits, proxies, initial access, laundering. The resilience of these structures rests precisely on their capacity to rapidly recompose their linkages whenever an element is disrupted.

## Online scams: the organization behind the volume

Online scams perfectly illustrate this evolution. They are no longer the work of isolated individuals but of organizations that combine social engineering, digital infrastructure, automation, and financial logistics.

Analyses by Europol, the UNODC, and other organizations show that these networks operate like genuine criminal enterprises: recruitment via social networks, task segmentation, behavioral scripts, use of encrypted messaging, circulation of guides and tutorials, internal platforms, and rapid conversion of gains.

Beyond the variety of stratagems, the structure itself matters: fraud is embedded within an organized, modular, distributed environment — an ecosystem. And at the heart of this ecosystem is a technique that recurs systematically and has its own sub-ecosystem: phishing.

## Phishing: an industry-level activity

Often presented as a simple social engineering maneuver, phishing today constitutes one of the most structured subsystems of digital crime. Research shows that the activity relies on a clear division of roles: kit design, development of covert hosting infrastructure, management of target databases, automation of distribution, credential collection, resale or reuse of the data.

This segmentation is supported by a flourishing phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) market. On criminal marketplaces circulate kits that integrate cloned pages, anti-detection modules, cloaking systems, anti-bot measures, real-time tracking dashboards, automatic updates, and integrations with Telegram or other messaging platforms.

At the same time, botnets have long held a central place in this environment:

1. as distribution platforms, enabling large-scale phishing campaigns by circumventing anti-spam measures;
2. as support infrastructures, hosting or relaying phishing pages through distributed networks such as fast-flux.

Recent judicial operations have highlighted the robustness of these ecosystems. The 2023 dismantling of QakBot revealed an infrastructure used for sophisticated phishing campaigns relying on the diversion of existing conversations and payload delivery to other groups. Emotet, before it, had illustrated the capacity of a network to combine propagation via phishing, access-for-rent services, and distribution of malicious payloads.

In these examples, phishing is not an isolated operation: it is an entry point to a system — an essential link in an ecosystem that articulates tools, infrastructure, skills, and markets.

## A dynamic that extends beyond the digital

This ecosystem logic now extends beyond the boundaries of cybercrime. Drug trafficking, for example, has structured itself around similar practices: recruitment, segmentation, digital logistics, use of social networks, cryptocurrencies, subcontracting of technical or operational tasks. The point is not to say these phenomena are identical, but to observe that they share comparable organizational mechanisms.

Agencies such as the UNODC confirm that criminals have adopted advanced technologies — malware, cryptocurrencies, generative AI — to reinforce their capabilities, automate tasks, diversify methods, and facilitate laundering of massive sums. These innovations allow them to shift activities across jurisdictions, continuously adapt their economic models, and more effectively circumvent enforcement measures.

Criminal groups rely heavily on clandestine marketplaces, notably on Telegram, where services, stolen data, fraud solutions, laundering mechanisms, and forced labor are exchanged. These platforms play a central role in maintaining and expanding a transnational criminal ecosystem that is particularly resilient.

The colossal scale of this criminal economy has led to the industrialization of fraud operations. Small dispersed groups have been replaced by larger, more structured organizations often based in industrial parks, special economic zones, casinos, or hotels, which serve as bases for operations. Many different actors operate at these sites, each conducting various illicit activities targeting victims worldwide.

## More nebulous organizations: the example of ShinyHunters

Recent evolutions illustrate how some cybercrime groups organize around distributed value chains. One emblematic case is ShinyHunters, active since 2019, which became visible through a series of massive data thefts and subsequent resale or extortion of these databases on breach forums.

Analyses indicate the use of stolen credentials, lack of multifactor authentication, and data exfiltration from major services. Judicial investigations confirm the existence of a distributed ecosystem: the arrest and conviction of certain suspects in 2024 did not end the group’s activities, and multiple arrests related to marketplace administration in 2025 suggest the existence of several circles operating under the same banner.

To add to the complexity of observing such groups, ShinyHunters appears distinct from groups like Lapsus$ or Scattered Spider, yet several analyses have highlighted the emergence, in 2024–2025, of an opportunistic alliance under the name “Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH)”: a “super-group” or “federated brand” used by different actors, notably on Telegram.

This type of organization — fluid identities, lack of stable hierarchy, ability to recompose despite arrests — confirms the need to consider these threats as ecosystems, in which specialized roles, distributed infrastructure, compromised access, and data marketplaces combine.

## Thinking and acting “at the ecosystem level”

For judicial actors as well as researchers, this transformation demands continued adaptation in how we analyze and address crime:

1. **Develop a systemic understanding of threats.**  
   A phishing campaign or a botnet is never an isolated phenomenon; it is the expression of a distributed system where every action is supported by other actors, services, and infrastructure.

2. **Target dependencies rather than just operators.**  
   The effectiveness of responses lies in identifying intermediaries, rented services, and the technical and economic flows that make the organization possible.

3. **Disrupt chains, not merely symptoms.**  
   Neutralizing a server or arresting an individual is often insufficient if the ecosystem can immediately recompose itself. Effective action must target anchor points: hosting providers, proxies, specialized vendors, financial flows, and recruitment mechanisms.

4. **Mobilize interdisciplinarity.**  
   Technical analysis must be combined with approaches from criminology, psychology, criminal economics, and data analysis.

5. **Build anticipation capabilities.**  
   Proactivity is no longer a luxury; it is a condition of effectiveness. Understanding criminal ecosystems means understanding where they can be weakened — and acting before they reconfigure. It also means detecting them as early as possible, when they are still building their infrastructure and setting up coordination mechanisms.

Ten years after completing my thesis work, botnets appear not as a thing of the past but as an analytical model that illuminates many contemporary criminal phenomena. They are no longer merely compromised machines: they are structures, actors, and relationships.

Ecosystems.

And it is at this scale that we must think and act.
