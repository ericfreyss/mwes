When I defended my doctoral thesis in November 2015, I was trying to define a model for all malware at the time that was in some way connected to its owner, and I particularly advocated the following concept: to consider botnets not as mere networks of compromised machines, but as socio-technical assemblages composed of actors, infrastructure, economic flows, and organizational constraints.

This reading, which associates technical analysis with an understanding of human dynamics, led to speaking of systems rather than isolated tools, and of criminal ecosystems rather than discrete threats. I also emphasized the need for a proactive posture aimed at disrupting the criminal organization as a whole — not just its visible manifestations.

Ten years later, this perspective has lost none of its relevance ([Revue des Mines, 2025](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/)). What has changed, however, is the scale of the phenomenon. The ecosystem logics observed in botnets have spread throughout cybercrime and have even taken root in certain segments of so-called “traditional” crime. To go further, one can notably read the book by Benoît Dupont, *[Cybercrime, an Ecosystemic Approach to Cyberspace](https://presses.umontreal.ca/9782761387186/cybercrime/)*, which develops the notion of project-based delinquency.

## From cyber threats to criminal ecosystems

Beginning in the 2010s, cybercrime underwent profound reconfiguration. Operations fragmented into a multitude of specialized roles: malware developers, initial access operators, infrastructure managers, data resellers, money launderers, technical service providers — and, as Benoît Dupont describes, it is organized around a service marketplace that allows each skill to be recruited, rented, or replaced.

This segmentation, combined with extensive outsourcing, enabled the emergence of genuine criminal value chains, where each function can be rented, replaced, or automated.

This logic of modularity has become the norm. Groups no longer execute the entire chain themselves: they select, purchase, or combine services — “bulletproof” hosting, encryptors, ready-to-use kits, proxies, initial access, laundering. The resilience of these structures rests precisely on their capacity to rapidly recompose their linkages whenever an element is disrupted.

## Online scams: the organization behind the volume

Online scams perfectly illustrate this evolution. They are no longer the work of isolated individuals but of organizations that combine social engineering, digital infrastructure, automation, and financial logistics.

Analyses by Europol, the UNODC, and other organizations show that these networks operate like genuine criminal enterprises: recruitment via social networks, task segmentation, behavioral scripts, use of encrypted messaging, circulation of guides and tutorials, internal platforms, and rapid conversion of gains.

Beyond the variety of stratagems, the structure itself matters: fraud is embedded within an organized, modular, distributed environment — an ecosystem. And at the heart of this ecosystem is a technique that recurs systematically and has its own sub-ecosystem: phishing.

## Phishing: an industry-level activity

Often presented as a simple social engineering maneuver, phishing today constitutes one of the most structured subsystems of digital crime. Research shows that the activity relies on a division of roles: kit design, development of covert hosting infrastructure, management of target databases, automation of distribution, credential collection, resale or reuse of the data.

This segmentation is supported by a flourishing phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) market. On criminal marketplaces circulate kits that integrate cloned pages, anti-detection modules, cloaking systems, anti-bot measures, real-time dashboards, automatic updates, and integrations with messaging platforms.

At the same time, botnets have long held a central place in this environment:

1. **as distribution platforms**, enabling large-scale phishing campaigns by circumventing anti-spam measures;  
2. **as support infrastructures**, hosting or relaying phishing pages through distributed networks such as fast-flux.

Recent judicial operations have highlighted the robustness of these ecosystems.  
The **2023 dismantling of QakBot** exposed an infrastructure used for sophisticated phishing campaigns, relying on the diversion of existing email conversations and the distribution of payloads to other groups.  
**Emotet**, before it, had shown the capacity of a network to combine propagation via phishing, access-for-rent services, and delivery of malicious payloads.

In these examples, phishing is not an isolated operation: it is an entry point to a system — an essential link in an ecosystem that articulates tools, infrastructure, skills, and markets.

## A dynamic that extends beyond the digital

This ecosystem logic now extends beyond the boundaries of cybercrime. Drug trafficking, for example, has structured itself around similar practices: recruitment, segmentation, digital logistics, use of social networks, cryptocurrencies, subcontracting of technical or operational tasks. The point is not equivalence but similarity in organizational mechanisms.

The **UNODC** confirms that criminals have adopted advanced technologies — malware, cryptocurrencies, generative AI — to reinforce their capabilities, automate tasks, diversify methods, and launder massive sums. These innovations allow them to shift activities across jurisdictions, continuously adapt their economic models, and circumvent enforcement measures.

Criminal groups rely heavily on clandestine marketplaces, notably on **Telegram**, where services, stolen data, fraud solutions, laundering mechanisms, and forced labor are exchanged.

This criminal economy has scaled to the point of industrialization: small dispersed groups replaced by larger organizations based in **industrial parks**, **special economic zones**, **casinos**, or **hotels**, functioning as operational hubs hosting multiple actors who conduct illicit activities targeting victims worldwide.

## More nebulous organizations: the example of ShinyHunters

Recent evolutions show how some cybercrime groups organize around distributed value chains.  
**ShinyHunters**, active since 2019, is emblematic: massive data thefts, resale or extortion on breach forums, and persistent activity despite arrests.

Analyses indicate:

- extensive use of stolen credentials,  
- lack of multifactor authentication,  
- exfiltration from major online services.

Judicial investigations confirm a distributed ecosystem: the **2024 convictions** of some suspects did not end operations, and **multiple arrests in 2025** tied to marketplace administration suggest several circles operating under the same “brand”.

To complicate matters, ShinyHunters appears distinct from groups such as **Lapsus$** or **Scattered Spider**, yet several analyses in 2024–2025 have noted the emergence of an opportunistic alliance sometimes referred to as **“Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH)”**, acting as a flexible, federated label used by different actors — particularly on Telegram.

This fluidity — shifting identities, recomposition after arrests, lack of hierarchy — confirms the need to consider these threats as **ecosystems rather than discrete groups**.

## Thinking and acting at the ecosystem level

For judicial actors as well as researchers, this transformation requires continued adaptation in how we analyze and address crime:

1. **Develop a systemic understanding of threats.**  
   A phishing campaign or a botnet is never an isolated event; it is the expression of a distributed system supported by many actors, services, and infrastructure.

2. **Target dependencies rather than individuals.**  
   Effective action lies in identifying intermediaries, suppliers, rented services, and the technical and economic flows that sustain the organization.

3. **Disrupt chains, not symptoms.**  
   Neutralizing a server or arresting an individual is insufficient if the ecosystem can rapidly reconstitute itself.  
   Action must focus on anchor points: hosting providers, proxy chains, specialized vendors, financial flows, recruitment channels.

4. **Mobilize interdisciplinarity.**  
   Technical analysis must be combined with criminology, psychology, economics of crime, and data analysis.

5. **Build anticipation capabilities.**  
   Proactivity is essential. Understanding criminal ecosystems means identifying where they can be weakened — and acting before they reconfigure.

Ten years after completing my thesis, botnets appear not as a relic but as a model illuminating contemporary criminal phenomena.  
**They are no longer merely compromised machines: they are structures, actors, and relationships. Ecosystems. And it is at this scale that we must think and act.**
